<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- text about the real time prediction -->
Real-time series forecasting is the process of using machine learning techniques to predict future values of a time series based on its past values. In the deep learning world, this is often achieved by training a neural network on a dataset containing a large number of historical time series data points. The neural network is then able to make predictions about future values of the time series by learning patterns and trends from the historical data.

One of the key challenges in real-time series forecasting is the need for the prediction model to be able to adapt and learn from new data as it becomes available. This requires the use of techniques such as online learning and transfer learning, which allow the model to continuously update its predictions as new data becomes available.

Another challenge in real-time series forecasting is the need to handle large amounts of data in a timely manner. This requires the use of efficient algorithms and techniques such as parallel processing and distributed computing, which can help to speed up the training and prediction process.

Overall, real-time series forecasting is an important area of machine learning that has many applications in fields such as finance, energy, and transportation. By using deep learning techniques, it is possible to make accurate predictions about future values of a time series and to continuously update these predictions as new data becomes available.

<br>

The project is a part of the Data Science and Big Data course at the University of Sfax. The project is about creating a real-time analytics system using Apache Spark and LSTM. The project is divided into two parts: the first part is about creating a real-time analytics system using Apache Spark and the second part is about creating a real-time analytics system using LSTM , to solve the general problem of big data anayltic 5V.

## Built In Technologie
There are numerous technologies employed in this project's final product, taking into account design, back-end, front-end, and more, but we may concentrate on the most crucial one as the following.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

_The project's concept may seem a little sophisticated, but the steps for getting started are quite simpler. We may summarize them as follows.._

1. Make sure that connection is really istablished
2. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bouslama-hamza/APACHE-SPARK.git
   ```

3. Go To the Real Time Series Folder
   ```
   cd Real Time Series Prediction/
   ```

4. Install Django packages
   ```
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```
   
5. Make Migrations to launch the data base
   ```
    python manage.py makemigration
   ``` 
   ```
    python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Run the server
   ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
